# Asteroid Data Analysis Project ðŸŒ   

## Overview  
This project is part of a course in the Computer Science program at the Open University of Israel. It involves analyzing NASAâ€™s asteroid dataset to uncover insights about asteroid magnitudes, diameters, and proximity to Earth. The data is processed, cleaned, and visualized to highlight key trends.

## Features  
âœ” **Data Cleaning** â€“ Processed raw data using **Pandas**, handling missing values and inconsistencies  
âœ” **Proximity Filtering** â€“ Identified asteroids passing near Earth using **distance thresholds**  
âœ” **Magnitude & Diameter Analysis** â€“ Explored relationships between asteroid brightness and size  
âœ” **Data Visualization** â€“ Used **Matplotlib** to generate insightful charts and graphs  

## Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **Pandas** (Data Cleaning & Processing)  
- **Matplotlib** (Visualizations)  
- **Jupyter Notebook** (Development & Analysis)  

## Dataset  
The dataset is sourced from **NASA's Near Earth Object (NEO) Database**. It includes asteroid parameters such as **absolute magnitude, estimated diameter, close approach data, and velocity**.

# Asteroid Data Analysis Project ðŸŒ 

## Overview
This project is part of the Data Analysis in Python course at the Open University of Israel. It involves analyzing NASAâ€™s asteroid dataset to derive meaningful insights related to asteroid magnitudes, diameters, and their proximity to Earth. The project includes the cleaning, processing, and visualization of the data to identify key trends and patterns.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Cleaned raw asteroid data using Pandas, addressing missing values and resolving inconsistencies.
- **Proximity Filtering**: Filtered asteroids based on their proximity to Earth, using predefined distance thresholds.
- **Magnitude & Diameter Analysis**: Analyzed the correlation between asteroid brightness and size.
- **Data Visualization**: Utilized Matplotlib to generate graphs and charts, facilitating better understanding of the data.

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas** â€“ Data cleaning, processing, and handling missing data.
- **Matplotlib** â€“ Visualizing the processed data.
- **Jupyter Notebook** â€“ Development environment used for analysis.

## Dataset
The dataset is sourced from NASA's Near-Earth Object (NEO) Database. It includes asteroid parameters such as absolute magnitude, estimated diameter, close approach data, and velocity. The dataset provides insights into the movement and size of asteroids in proximity to Earth.

## Achievement
This project received a grade of **100** as part of the Data Analysis in Python course at the Open University of Israel.
